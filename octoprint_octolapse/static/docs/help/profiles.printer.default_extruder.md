This extruder will be used if no other extruder has been set with a T command.  This option is only available if the **Number of Extruders** setting is 2 or more.

**Important note to users of the Prusa MMU printers** - If you are printing in single material mode, make sure you select the extruder you plan to print before every print UNLESS you are using Slic3rPE or PrusaSlicer AND are using 'Automatic Configuration' for your slicer type.  If you do not do this, Octolapse may use settings from the wrong extruder, which can degrade print quality.
