Your printer profile has fewer extruder offsets defined than extruders.  This is an unexpected error, and is probably a bug in Octolapse.  Double check your printer profile and make sure the number of extruders is correct.  If your printer has one nozzle, but supports multi materials (like the Prusa MMU), be sure to check the 'shared nozzle' box in your printer profile.
