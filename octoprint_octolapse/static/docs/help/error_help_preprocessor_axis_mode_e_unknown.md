Octolapse could not detect your E Axis mode.  There are two solutions:  

1. Either add an ```M82``` to the very top of your start gcode in your slicer.
2. Edit your Octolapse printer profile, find the **Firmware Settings** section and set the **E Axis Mode** to **Absolute**.  
 
_Note for option 2:  If you can't find the E-Axis Mode setting, make sure **Customize Profile** is checked under the **Import Printer Profile** section._
