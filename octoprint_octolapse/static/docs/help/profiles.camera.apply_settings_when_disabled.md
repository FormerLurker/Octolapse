When checked, Octolapse will apply custom web camera image preferences even if the camera is disabled.  This is useful if you are not using the camera to generate a timelapse, but still want the custom image preferences to be applied on reboot.

If Octolapse is disabled within the plugin manager, the custom image preferences will *never* be applied.

If timelapses are disabled (the *Plugin Enabled* setting on the Octolapse Tab), the custom image preferences will **not** be applied before prints start, but *will* be applied on reboot if this option is enabled.
