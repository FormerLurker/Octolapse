This script can be used to prepare your camera before any printing starts.  I used this script to erase all of the existing images on my DSLR and to adjust the settings.  It could be used for a variety of purposes.  Currently only one parameter is passed into the script, the camera's name, but only because I'm not sure what might be useful here.  Let me know what arguments would be useful and I'll consider adding them.

The *Test* button will run this script with the **Snapshot Timeout**, but during a live print there is no timeout.  This is to prevent scripts from running for an unusual amount of time when testing.

Parameters:

* Camera Name - The name of the camera profile used to generate the images
