You printer does not support a critical gcode, M114, which Octolapse uses to correctly time snapshots.  You can solve this problem by flashing your printer with firmware that supports this gcode.  I recommend you contact the manufacturer, since this gcode is required for many OctoPrint plugins, and is considered a standard.
