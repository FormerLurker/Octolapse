Due to limitations of either your python version, file system, or OS, the zip file you are trying to import is too large to be opened.

### Possible Solutions

1.  Upgrade to python 3.  This requires Octoprint 1.4.0 or above.
2.  Reduce the zip file size.  You can either remove images or reduce the resolution.
3.  Change your SD card's file system.  Fat32 is limited to files smaller than 4 GB.
