The printer profile you have selected was never configured.  This probably means that you upgraded Octolapse to a newer version, and are using a migrated profile that has never been configured before.  First, open the Octolapse tab and expand the **Current Run Configuration** section.  The click on the edit Pen to the right of the printer profile drop down box.  All of the default profiles from the previous version of Octolapse can be imported automatically, and are pre-configured.  Look for your printer in the **Make** drop down box under the **Import Printer Profile** section.  A new dropdown box called **Model** will appear.  Select your Model there.  Next, you will need to configure your slicer settings.  Use the help icon (question mark) next to the **Slicer Type** drop down for more information about entering your slicer settings.
