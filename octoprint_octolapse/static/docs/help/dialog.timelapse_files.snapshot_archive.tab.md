Octolapse can save a .zip file containing all of your snapshots and settings.  Archiving can be enabled in two ways:

1.  If rendering is disabled, an archive will always be produced.
2.  If rendering is enabled, Octolapse will produce an archive if the **Files and Performance** heading of your **Rendering** profile.  It is disabled by default, since it takes a lot of space.

Archives will appear within this tab after rendering has completed successfully.  You can download, delete, or render any archives, or you can import new archive files (see the **Import Snapshot Archive (.zip)** help icon for more details about importing archives).

### Downloading Archives
Simply click the <i class="fa fa-download" title="Download Icon"></i> icon to download an archive.

### Deleting Archives
You can delete an archive by clicking the <i class="fa fa-delete" title="Delete Icon"></i> icon, or by selecting one or more archives and clicking the **Delete** button above the selection column.

### Add Archives to Unfinished Renderings
By clicking the <i class="fa fa-film" title="Film Icon"></i> icon you can add any archive to the unfinished rendering list.  You can access this list by closing the **Videos and Images** dialog, and clicking on the red **Unfinished Renderings** button.  From there you will be able to change settings and render a timelapse video from your archive.

Note:  Adding archives to the unfinished rendering list will take up at least as much disk space as the size of the archive.  Make sure you have plenty of free disk space before adding archives to the unfinished renderings and before initiating video rendering.

### Importing Archives
Octolapse supports importing zip files.  See the help icon next to the **Import Snapshot Archive** control for more details.
