Octolapse was not able to find ffmpeg at the path set in OctoPrint's settings.  In order to render videos, Octolapse must be able to find ffmpeg or avconv.  It must be installed on your machine manually if you are using Windows or MacOS.  If you are using OctoPi, ffmpeg/avconv is already installed and configured.  If you installed OctoPrint manually, you might need to install ffmpeg or avconv manually.
 
 The location of ffmpeg/avconv is stored within Octoprint's settings.  You can edit the location by opening OctoPrint's settings (the wrench/spanner icon at the top of the OctoPrint webpage), and selecting **Webcam & Timelapse** under the **FEATURES** heading in the menu on the right hand side of the settings popup.  Then scroll down to find the **Timelapse Recordings** settings, and edit the **Path to FFMPEG**.  Click the **Test** button to verify that ffmpeg/avconv exists at the specified location.  Be sure to click 'Save' when you are finished editing this setting.
