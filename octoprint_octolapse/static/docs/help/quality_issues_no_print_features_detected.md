This error means that gcode comments are missing from your gcode file.  These comments tell Octolapse what print features are currently printing, like Infill, interior and exterior permieters, skirts, ooze shields and more.

If you are using Slic3r or PrusaSlicer, see [this guide](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/wiki/V0.4---Slic3r-Slic3r-PE-and-PrusaSlicer) for enabling verbose gcode comments.

If you are using Cura or Simplify 3d, consider creating an [issue report](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/wiki/V0.4---Reporting-An-Issue), because this isn't supposed to happen.

If you are using any other slicer, Octolapse does not currently support feature detection.  Feel free to submit a feature request enabling Octolapse to recognize your slicer.  Learn how to create a feature request [here](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/wiki/V0.4---Request-A-New-Feature).
