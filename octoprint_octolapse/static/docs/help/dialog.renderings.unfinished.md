This dialog shows any renderings that have not finished, or have been added from the timelapse archive dialog.

There are three main things you can do in this page:

1.  Render unfinished timelapses
2.  Delete unfinished rendering files
3.  Download images in a zip archive from any unfinished timelapse

## Rendering

Rendering unfinished timelapses is as simple as clicking  the <i class="fa fa-film" class="Film Icon" title="Film Icon"></i> icon.  This will immediately start rendering the timelapse with the current settings.

Octolapse tries to render your timelapse using the camera and rendering settings that you originally used to generate the snapshots.  In some cases Octolapse may not be able to recover these settings, for example if the snapshots were taken prior to Octolapse v0.4, or if you manually uploaded images via the **Saved Snapshots** tab within the **Videos and Images** dialog.  In this case, Octolapse will attempt to render the files using your current rendering settings and the default camera settings.  If you wish to use other settings, you can select them in the dropdown list prior to rendering the timelapse.

You can also select multiple rows and render all selected items by clicking the **Render/Delete** button and selecting **Render All Selected**.  If you plan to render a lot of videos, please keep in mind that this could take a really long time.

## Delete

If you want to delete any unfinished renderings, just click the <i class="fa fa-trash" title="Delete Icon"></i> icon.  You can also delete all selected items by clicking the **Render/Delete** button and selecting **Delete All Selected**.  Please note that this will delete all of the snapshots permanently.

## Download

Click on the <i class="fa fa-download" title="Download Icon"></i> icon to zip and download snapshot files.  Please note that this operation may take a while if there are a lot of images in the timelapse.  Also, it will require approximately as much free disk space to archive the snapshots as the images themselves take up, so be sure you have enough free space before downloading images!
