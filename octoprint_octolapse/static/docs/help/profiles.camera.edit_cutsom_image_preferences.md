After enabling custom image preferences and saving your profile, your camera settings can be changed from the Octolapse tab.  Under the **Timelapse Preview** display select your camera from the drop down box.  Now click the edit pen that appears to the right of the drop down box.  If the pen is not there, make sure custom image preferences are enabled for the selected camera (be sure to save your changes).
