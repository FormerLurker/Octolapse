Octolapse was not able to track your printer's movements.  This is usually a problem detecting the current axis mode, incorrect distance units (only metric units are supported currently), problems detecting homing, or problems parsing your gcode file.

If other errors were reported, solving those will likely fix this error.  If no other issues were reported by Octolapse, it's time to create an issue.
