<!--
READ THE FOLLOWING FIRST:

I like to keep things clean.  This is a place to
reporting bugs and request new features, but is not a good place
to ask questions about or learn how to use octoprint.  Unfortunately
there is currently no user form, but you can find lots of information
in the Wiki (https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/wiki).  For now, if
you get stuck and can't find help please send an email to:
FormerLurker@pm.me.

For feature requests, add the prefix "[Request]" in the title (without the
quotes).

Do not delete anything from the template except where noted or the
bot will complain.

Thanks!

#### When you ran into the problem, did you have diagnostic logging enabled?
<!--
You can find out more about diagnostic logging here:
https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/wiki/Debug-Profiles#log-additional-information

It is very helpful for certain problems.  If you can reproduce the issue with
one of the Diagnostic logging profiles, please do so before submitting an issue.

#### Link to the gcode file you were printing when the problem occurred
<!--
Many problems I've seen are due to specific gcode files.
Sometimes it's a bug, sometimes it can be slicer settings,
other times it can be Octolapse or OctoPrint setting related.


In any case, the gcode file is often very useful.
On gist.github.com or pastebin.com.

#### Link to settings.json
<!--
Lots of problems are settings related, and having them available
makes debugging a lot easier.  You can export the settings.json
file from within the Octoprint settings.

BE AWARE - IF YOU HAVE ANY PASSWORDS IN YOUR CAMERA PROFILE,
THEY WILL BE EXPORTED ALONG WITH THE REST OF YOUR SETTINGS!
IF YOU ARE USING CAMERA AUTHENTICATION IN ANY OF YOUR PROFILES,
EITHER REMOVE THE PASSWORDS BEFORE EXPORTING, DELETE THEM FROM THE FILE
AFTER EXPORTING, OR DON'T POST SETTINGS.JSON!  You can search for

"password":

to find all of the entries containing passwords.
OMIT ONLY IF YOU HAVE ENTERED A PASSWORD TO ACCESS YOUR CAMERA
WITHIN OCTOLAPSE
!-->
Link to settings.json with all passwords removed: SETTINGS_JSON_LINK_GOES_HERE


#### Link to plugin_octolapse.log
<!--
On gist.github.com or pastebin.com.

DO NOT OMIT IF YOU ARE USING OCTOLAPSE V0.2.2 OR LATER.

SINCE IT MAY CONTAIN CAMERA AUTHENTICATION PASSWORDS IF THEY WERE
ENTERED.

putting your issue into words.  A picture speaks 1000 of them, afterall!

## Please consider becoming a patron
If you like this project, [please support my work by becoming a patron,](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=9588101) and consider adding a 'star' to the repository.  It takes a lot of time and effort to maintain the project and respond to issues.  The cost of test prints, software, cameras, printer parts, etc. can quickly add up, so every bit helps.
